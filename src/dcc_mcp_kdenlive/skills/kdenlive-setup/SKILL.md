# Kdenlive Setup

Discover and describe tools before calls. File edits create new artifacts; inspect the returned file before opening it in the editor. Supply expected_sha256 for revision fencing. Frames are integers; end frames are inclusive. File results are not live editor readback.

Grouped clips, nested sequences, timeline model operations and other editor-only features use the shared ui-control skill on a GUI instance bound to an exact Kdenlive PID and HWND. Report provider=dcc-cua and its runtime version before UI observation. Use snapshot -> act -> snapshot and stop the session when done. Never switch to another UI provider or retry after a policy rejection or user interruption.

For rendering, poll the core job ID until terminal; a timeout is not completion. Cancellation terminates the owned render process and cleans partial output.
